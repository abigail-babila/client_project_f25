        <h2>What is a Portfolio?</h2>
        <p>
            A portfolio is a digital collection that showcases your skills, experiences, and growth in career-related projects. A portfolio is more than just displaying your work. It's about showcasing who you are and what makes you different from other applicants in your field - whether it is in user experience, data science, librarianship, health informatics, or another field.
            <br><br>
            Your portfolio serves as a central hub for potential employers, internship coordinators, and collaborators to explore your projects, case studies, and accomplishments. It highlights not only what you have done, but also how you approach problems, collaborate with others, and apply your learning in real-world situations.
            <br><br>
            Most UMSI students create their portfolios as personal websites, making them accessible anytime and anywhere. This allows you to share your work easily during job and internship searches, networking, and interviews. 
            <br><br>
            The CDO recommends using your portfolio to:
            <ul>
                <li>Explore and communicate your interests in different career paths</li>
                <li>Showcase application materials such as your resume and project case studies</li>
                <li>Highlight your networking and collaboration experiences</li>
                <li>Prepare for interviews by reflecting on your work and articulating your impact</li>
                <li>Demonstrate your ability to organize and present information clearly—one of UMSI’s unique strengths</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Coded vs. Design Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main approaches: <strong>coded portfolios</strong> and <strong>design platform portfolios</strong>. Each has its own advantages, so consider your technical skills, time investment, and the type of work you want to showcase when making your choice.
            <br><br>
            A <strong>coded portfolio</strong> is a personal site you build using HTML, CSS, and other programming languages. This type showcases not only your work, but also your web development and design skills. You have complete control over layout, features, and branding, helping you stand out to employers—especially in tech or design fields.
            <br><br>
            In contrast, a <strong>design platform portfolio</strong> (like Wix or Squarespace) is hosted on a third-party service. These platforms offer pre-built templates and easy drag-and-drop options, making setup quick and straightforward with no coding needed. These sites are ideal for visually showcasing your projects and are often favored for creative roles.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Coded Portfolios</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Coded portfolios are best if you want to <strong>demonstrate your technical skills</strong> rather than just describing them. Coded portfolios are great since you have <strong>full customization</strong> control of the design, functionality, and user experience without being limited to a template. This allows you to create a unique and personalized showcase of your work.

        <h3>Designed Portfolios</h3>
        <p>
            Non-coded portfolios are perfect if you want to <strong>quickly and easily</strong> showcase your work without learning how to code. These platforms let you <strong>focus on your work, visuals, and storytelling</strong>, while providing a polished and professional look to your digital brand. You can still personalize your content and appearance, though you may be more limited than with a fully coded site.

        <h2>Portfolio FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>What if I have few projects?</strong><br>
        Include projects from class projects, hackathons, volunteer work, or personal initiatives you've done. What matters most is demonstrating your skills and thinking process clearly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Should I include projects that are not yet completed?</strong><br>
        Yes! Including work-in-progress projects can show your current skills and interests. Just be sure to clearly label them as ongoing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What if my projects are under NDA or confidential?</strong><br>
        Describe your role, process, and impact in general terms without sharing sensitive details or visuals. Focus on your skills and what you learned from the experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do I need a custom domain (like yourname.com)?</strong><br>
        While a custom domain can enhance your professional image, it's not strictly necessary, especially when first making your portfolio. Many portfolio platforms offer free subdomains that can work well for showcasing your work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How often should I update my portfolio?</strong><br>
        It's recommended that you review and update your site every semester, or whenever you complete a big project. Remove old or less relevant work as you grow.
      </li>
    </ul>
