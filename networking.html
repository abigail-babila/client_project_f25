                Great careers start with great connections. Networking isn’t just about collecting business cards or LinkedIn contacts—it’s about finding people who inspire you, support your growth, and open doors to new opportunities. But if networking feels overwhelming or out of reach, don’t worry! We’re here to help guide you, no matter where you’re starting.

        <h2>How Do I Network?</h2>
        <p>
            There are many ways to connect with people, both online and in person. Here's a quick rundown of simple steps you can take to build your professional network:
        </p>
        <div>
            <h3>Find Alumni</h3>
            <ul>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Getting a Response</h3>
            <p>
                Don't be discouraged if you don't hear back! The main goal is to get a response and spark a conversation with someone.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep it Short</strong><br>
                    Emphasize how you respect their time and efforts to help you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Establish a Time Frame</strong><br>
                    Mention an estimated time of how long the meeting will be, giving them a clear idea of what to expect
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personalize the Message</strong><br>
                    Mention aspects of their background that interested you and made you want to connect with them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don't:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Do NOT ask for information that is readily available</strong><br>
                    Make sure you do your research before reaching out. Ask questions that show you are genuinely interested in their work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>NEVER send your resume firste</strong><br>
                    Always ask permission first before sendinh your resume. Your first goal is to build a relationship with them before asking for help.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Do NOT start off by asking for a referral</strong><br>
                    As mentioned before, focus on building a connection with the individual and be respectful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>NEVER ask for a job</strong><br>
                    Asking for a job immediately can come off negatively to professionals. Instead of "I saw this job posting, can you refer me?" say "I saw this job posting to a company you work for. Can you give me some guidance on the application process?"
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When crafting an email:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Strong Subject Line:</strong> Write something clear and concise to entice them to open the email.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mention a Personal Connection:</strong> Begin the email with context that shows how you're connected or why you're reaching out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Have a Clear Purpose:</strong> State why you're reaching out and what you hope to gain from their expertise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Concise Message:</strong> Keep the email brief and to the point, while also being polite and respectful of their time.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Following Up</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't hear back within a week or two, don't worry! People can get busy and emails can easily get lost in the inbox.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this happens to you, be sure to send a follow-up email politely asking if they are interested in connecting further. In the mean time, continue searching for more people to connect with and don't give up!
            </p>

        <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Do I need to network if I’m not sure about my career direction?</strong><br>
                Yes! Networking can help you explore different fields, learn about career paths, and clarify your interests. Conversations with professionals can expose you to roles and industries you may not know about.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What should I say when reaching out to someone I don’t know?</strong><br>
                Introduce yourself, explain how you found them, and share why you’re interested in connecting. Be specific and respectful of their time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How many people should I try to connect with?</strong><br>
                Focus on quality over quantity. Building a few meaningful relationships is more valuable than collecting many contacts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Are virtual networking and in-person networking equally valuable?</strong><br>
                Both methods offer unique benefits. Virtual networking is convenient and allows you to connect broadly, while in-person interactions can foster deeper connections more quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How do I handle awkward silences during networking conversations?</strong><br>
                Have a mental list of questions ready (e.g., “What led you to your current role?”). If conversation stalls, it’s okay to thank them and circulate.
            </li>
