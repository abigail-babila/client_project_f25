    <!-- Cover Letter Content -->
    <section>
      <h2>What is a Cover Letter?</h2>
      <p>
        Your cover letter is your opportunity to bring your application to life—transforming a list of qualifications into a compelling narrative that connects your experiences, ambitions, and personality directly to the position you’re seeking. A cover letter allows you to demonstrate how and why you are uniquely suited for a specific role. It is your chance to move beyond what you have done and share who you are: your motivation, your enthusiasm for the work, and the distinct perspective you bring.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a UMSI student preparing for a competitive and dynamic job market, an engaging cover letter can help you stand out by giving employers a window into not only your capabilities, but also your values and career goals. Whether you are applying for your first internship, a research position, or your next step after graduation, an effective cover letter enables you to highlight your fit with an organization’s mission and culture—a crucial consideration for today’s employers.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h3>Cover Letter Steps to Success</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review the Job Description:</strong> Identify what excites you about the organization and how your skills match what they seek.</li>
            <li><strong>Tell Your Story:</strong> Use the letter to demonstrate your enthusiasm and explain “why them, why you.”</li>
            <li><strong>Reference Relevant Experiences:</strong> Tie specific examples back to the position, showing how you can contribute.</li>
            <li><strong>Customize Each Letter:</strong> Avoid generic letters—employers notice when you’ve researched their company and culture.</li>
            <li><strong>Edit and Refine:</strong> Proofread for clarity and errors, and keep your tone professional but authentic.</li>
